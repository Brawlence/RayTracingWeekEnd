Ray Tracing Weekend
====================================================================================================

This is a project dedicated to learning the basics of C-based raytracing following the footsteps
laid in the _Ray Tracing in One Weekend_ book by Peter Shirley.

## The source code and the Book
The _Ray Tracing in One Weekend_ series of books are now available to the public for free in PDF
form, along with the accompanying source code. Releases are available [directly from GitHub], or
from Eric Haine's [Real-Time Rendering] site. Alternatively, you can purchase the Kindle version of
this series from [Amazon.com]. Half of the proceeds of these sales go to [Hack the Hood], a really
neat organization.
