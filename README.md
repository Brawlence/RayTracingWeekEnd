# RayTracingWeekEnd

This is a project dedicated to learning the basics of C-based raytracing following the footsteps
laid in the _Ray Tracing in One Weekend_ book by Peter Shirley.

Command-line flags are parsed via CLI11, standart output is done with FMT and openGL rendering is provided by SFML.

## Dependencies

* CLI11 1.7.1 or higher
* SFML  2.5.0 or higher
* FMT   7.0.1 or higher 

## The Book
The _Ray Tracing in One Weekend_ series of books are now available to the public for free in PDF
form, along with the accompanying source code. Releases are available [directly from GitHub], or
from Eric Haine's [Real-Time Rendering] site. Alternatively, you can purchase the Kindle version of
this series from [Amazon.com].
